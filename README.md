## Day 3 – Arrays in C

### Program: Sum and Average of N Elements

- Took input of N numbers using array
- Used loop to read elements
- Calculated total sum
- Calculated average

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- for loop
- scanf and printf
- Arithmetic operations

**Location:**  
arrays/sumANDAverage.c

---

## Day 4 – Linear Search in C

### Program: Search an Element in an Array

- Accepted array input
- Searched for a given key
- Displayed position if found
- Displayed "Not Found" otherwise

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- for loop
- Conditional statements
- Linear search logic

**Location:**  
arrays/searchelement.c

## Day 5 – 3D Array Student Result Management

### Program: Student Marks Using 3D Array

- Stored marks using a 3D array (students × subjects × semesters)
- Calculated total marks for each student
- Calculated average marks
- Identified top scoring student

**Concepts Used:**
- 3D Arrays
- Nested loops
- Aggregation logic
- Conditional comparison

**Location:**  
arrays/student_result_3d_array.c

---

## How to Compile and Run

Make sure GCC is installed.

### On Linux / WSL:

```bash
gcc arrays/student_result_3d_array.c -o program
./program
```

### On Windows (MinGW):

```bash
gcc arrays/student_result_3d_array.c -o program
program
```

This repository will continue to grow as I progress into:
- More C programs
- Data structures
- Mini projects
- Full-stack development projects
