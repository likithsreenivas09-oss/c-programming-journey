## Topics Covered

- Pattern Printing
- Loops and Conditionals
- Nested Loops
- Arrays
- Linear Search
- Logical Problem Solving

## Day 1 – Inverted Repeating Number Pattern

### Example (n = 4)

1111  
222  
33  
4  

**Location:**  
patterns/inverted_repeating_number_pattern.c

## Day 3 – Arrays in C

### Program: Sum and Average of N Elements

- Took input of N numbers using array
- Used loop to read elements
- Calculated total sum
- Calculated average

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- for loop
- scanf and printf
- Arithmetic operations

**Location:**  
arrays/sumANDAverage.c

---

## Day 4 – Linear Search in C

### Program: Search an Element in an Array

- Accepted array input
- Searched for a given key
- Displayed position if found
- Displayed "Not Found" otherwise

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- for loop
- Conditional statements
- Linear search logic

**Location:**  
arrays/searchelement.c

## How to Compile and Run

Make sure GCC is installed.

### On Linux / WSL:

```bash
gcc patterns/symmetric_star_pattern.c -o pattern
./pattern
```

### On Windows (MinGW):

```bash
gcc arrays/sumANDAverage.c -o program
program
```

This repository will continue to grow as I progress into:
- More C programs
- Data structures
- Mini projects
- Full-stack development projects
